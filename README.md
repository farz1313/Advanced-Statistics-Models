In this project, I investigated how people develop skills and knowledge throughout their lifetime. In particular, I investigated how language exposure impacts later linguistic skills, cognitive abilities, and academic achievement.  The goal was to make several models, which quantify and test postulated theoretical assumptions.  <br>
Previous studies in language acquisition showed that language skills depend on the richness of the environment as well as number of other factors. In the case of this exam, I focused on the question of how people learn language and whether this influences other outcomes, such as university enrollment.
